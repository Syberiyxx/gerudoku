[This thread](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/2895569-gerudoku-legacy-thread-1-14-coming-soon-32x) is the last work I could find on this texture pack. I want to maintain it so we can remember the good old days of the Yogscast Minecraft Survival series. [This is a recreation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k9g6cpa7C_hHOdpL9azseGhDW_Gm9NZ4) of part of the Yogscast world I found online, I'm unaware of any better recreations. (edit: I was sent a copy of the original Shadow of Israphel map by an anonymous person. Apparently it was leaked back during the production of the series. I don't know how long this link will remain available: [Map leaked by Peva](https://www.mediafire.com/file/iwnx48tg7zyqc2o/Shadow_of_Israphel_Stolen_By_Peva_%25281%2529.zip/file)) Some original textures were also sent to me: These may be useful in updating GeruDoku: [textures](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9xjcus0ylu9wyng/Textures_%25281%2529.zip/file)

I've updated it to work with 1.14-1.17. I don't plan on creating art for anything that's missing. Feel free to contribute art on [Github](https://github.com/Syberiyxx/GeruDoku/issues/new). I'm maintaining it so that it works with the current version of Minecraft.
