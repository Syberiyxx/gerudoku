[This thread](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/2895569-gerudoku-legacy-thread-1-14-coming-soon-32x) is the last work I could find on this texture pack. I want to maintain it so we can remember the good old days of the Yogscast Minecraft Survival series. [This is a recreation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k9g6cpa7C_hHOdpL9azseGhDW_Gm9NZ4) of part of the Yogscast world I found online, I'm unaware of any better recreations.

I've updated it to work with 1.16. I don't plan on creating art for anything that's missing. Feel free to contribute art on [Github](https://github.com/Syberiyxx/GeruDoku/issues/new). I'm maintaining it so that it works with the current version of Minecraft.
